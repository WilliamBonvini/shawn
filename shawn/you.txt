Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I do not have the ability to draw images in command line art. However, here is an example of what a command line art of a dog might look like, written in ASCII:

 /\_/\  
( o   o )  
  > ^ <  

This represents a dog with its ears up and tongue out, standing on all fours.
